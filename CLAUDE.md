# CLAUDE.md — JSA Project Conventions

This file records non-derivable conventions for all agents working on this project. Architecture details live in `ARCH.md`; implementation status lives in `PLAN.md`. Only things that would be unclear from reading the code belong here.

---

## Sentinel protocol — MANDATORY for all agent prompts

Every prompt file (`jsa/prompts/PROMPT_CDADJUST.md`, `jsa/prompts/CVL_PROMPT.md`) **must** instruct the model to terminate every reply with exactly one of:

```
<<<NEED_INPUT>>>
<question to the user>
<<<END>>>
```
or
```
<<<FINAL>>>
<final markdown payload>
<<<END>>>
```

This is not optional — the pipeline parser (`jsa/agents/protocol.py`) will raise `ProtocolError` and mark the job `failed` if the sentinel is absent or malformed. When writing or editing prompt stubs, always include this instruction prominently at the end of the system prompt.

---

## State transitions

**Never set `Job.state` or `Job.current_stage` directly.** Always go through:
```python
from jsa.pipeline.state_machine import transition
transition(job, new_state, new_stage=None)  # raises InvalidTransition on violation
```
The allowed-transitions table is the single source of truth in `jsa/pipeline/state_machine.py`.

---

## Checkpoint rule

Every write that changes job state must be a **single atomic DB transaction** via:
```python
await repo.checkpoint(session, job, new_state, new_stage, messages=[], document=None, follow_up=None)
```
Never write `Message` rows, `Document` rows, and `Job` state in separate commits.

---

## Agent backend registration

New backends are registered in `jsa/agents/registry.py` by adding an entry to the `_REGISTRY` dict. The key is the CLI-flag string (e.g., `"claude-cli"`, `"gemini-cli"`, `"anthropic"`). Backends must subclass `AgentBackend` and implement all four abstract methods.

---

## Prompt files

- Location: `jsa/prompts/PROMPT_CDADJUST.md` and `jsa/prompts/CVL_PROMPT.md`
- Loaded by `jsa/prompts/loader.py` → `read_prompt(name)` — **no caching**, always reads from disk
- Edited externally by the user — never programmatically overwritten
- During development, use the stubs (which already contain the sentinel grammar instructions)

---

## Testing conventions

- **Fakes over mocks.** Use `tests/backend/fakes/fake_backend.py` (`FakeAgentBackend`) for all pipeline and orchestrator tests. Do not `patch` or `MagicMock` internal functions.
- **FakeRenderer** should write a stub file (e.g., write `b"PDF"` to the output path) — do not skip the renderer call in tests.
- Integration tests (real Claude/Gemini/Anthropic API) live in `tests/backend/integration/`, are marked `@pytest.mark.integration`, and are **skipped by default in CI**.
- Backend tests: `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Frontend tests: `vitest` + `@testing-library/react`.
- Follow TDD: write tests before or alongside implementation, not after.

---

## Renderer invocation

`WeasyPrintRenderer` (and any other `Renderer` implementation) is called **only when the user approves a job** via `POST /api/jobs/{id}/approve`. Never call the renderer speculatively or for preview — the frontend renders Markdown in-browser for previews.

---

## Concurrency — do not block the event loop

Any synchronous, CPU-bound, or blocking I/O call must be wrapped:
```python
await asyncio.to_thread(sync_function, *args)
```
This applies to: WeasyPrint, python-docx parsing, pypdf parsing, and any future sync library.

---

## Job identity and re-run semantics

- Job primary key: `sha1(f"{company}|{role}|{link}")[:16]`
- JD hash: `sha1(jd)[:16]`
- On re-run: `approved` + unchanged `jd_hash` → skip. `jd_hash` changed → reset to `pending`. `failed` → reset to `pending`. Everything else → resume from last checkpoint.

---

## Port and local-only

- Default port: `8765`. Override via `--port` flag or `JSA_PORT` env var.
- CORS is wide-open for `http://localhost:*`. This is intentional — single-user, local-only tool.
- No auth, no multi-user, no remote deployment ever intended for v1.

## Change log
2026-05-23 — Initial conventions document. Covers sentinel protocol, state transitions, checkpoint rule, backend registration, prompt files, testing conventions, renderer invocation, async discipline, job identity, and port config.
